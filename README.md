## 🛠️ From QBasic to Quality Assurance
My journey started in 1977. I grew up with the sounds of 8-bit loading and the logic of **MS-DOS** and **QBasic** on Osborne 1. This "old school" foundation taught me one thing: Code must be robust, and logic is king. Today, I bridge the gap between classic computing logic and modern web technologies, with a strong focus on **Software Testing & Quality Engineering**.

### 🔍 Focus: Quality & Testing
I believe that code is only as good as its tests. My goal is to build (and break) applications to ensure they are resilient and reliable.

- 🧪 **Unit Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library
- 🏗️ **Architecture:** Next.js, MongoDB, Clean Code
- 🐛 **Mindset:** "If it's not tested, it's broken."
